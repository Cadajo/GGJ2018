- ramp in which user has to decelerate (even break) or turn in the air to access shortcuts
- overcharging adjacent engines to generate energy beam (used for offense / defense)
- damaged part makes a worse use of the energy. needs more energy to achieve the same effect
- damaged part may leak energy, so its use gets punished
- maybe obstacle-filled section where needs to shield front
- overcharging for faster but riskier movement (engine output is a bit random when overcharged, even if higher. can cause discontrol)
- energy tank has max throughput, so charge/discharge speed is shared among engines. can charge single engine with the combined speed at which you'd charged the four of them simultaneously. so charging the four of them makes them charge at 1/4 the speed.

where could energy be used:
- shield (has sides?)
- attacks: (some laser thing)
- engine output
- 

- balance energy when part is damaged
- adjust motor energy for faster turning
- separate motor and shield energy management? instead of generating shield by overcharging. NAH. but then can't move forward while shielding the right. just deal with it?
-! if not enough energy, drain energy from the rest, or just do nothing?
