- ramp in which user has to decelerate (even break) or turn in the air to access shortcuts
- overcharging adjacent motors to generate energy beam (used for offense / defense)
- damaged part makes a worse use of the energy. needs more energy to achieve the same effect
- damaged part may leak energy, so its use gets punished
- maybe obstacle-filled section where needs to shield front
- overcharging for faster but riskier movement (motor forward is a bit random when overcharged, even if higher. can cause discontrol)
- energy tank has max throughput, so charge/discharge speed is shared among motors. can charge single motor with the combined speed at which you'd charged the four of them simultaneously. so charging the four of them makes them charge at 1/4 the speed.
